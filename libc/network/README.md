30 files are from musl 'as is' (`grep -P '^musl \+= network' Makefile`)

Possibly upgrade files in `libc/network` folder when merging ipv6 branch into master.

* `freeaddrinfo.o` - symlink to musl 0.9.12, in 1.1.24 more than LOCK, mess with changes to ai_buf struct (affects `getaddrinfo.c`_
* `getaddrinfo.c` - originates from musl but some changes were made on OSv side
* `gethostbyname_r.c` - originates from musl and is identical except for extra `gethostbyname()` that can probably be moved to a separate file
* `getifaddrs.c` - originates from musl but significantly changed on OSv in commits #41fc1499ed9cdf4f876135a723e5b0fa98453161 and #e9f12c3f35aa22db1c947690e5049b52b6246381
* `getnameinfo.c` - originates from musl but makes a change to first read `/etc/services`; look at #2c7f0a58b98abdf12d17c4ac71e334db4512b72f
* `__ipparse.c` - includes `__dns.hh` instead of `__dns.h`; removed from 1.1.24

These changed between 0.9.12, in 1.1.24 and these changes seem to have been at least partially addressed in ipv6 branch
* `if_indextoname.c` - `socket(AF_UNIX,..)` vs `socket(AF_INET,..)` and `syscall(close`
* `if_nameindex.c` - ...
* `if_nametoindex.c` - ... AND `strncpy` vs `strlcpy`

Ideally can be addressed without copying into osv tree by using socket and syscall macro overrides. The strncpy vs strlcpy situation is more tricky.
